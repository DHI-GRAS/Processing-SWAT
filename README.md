Processing-SWAT
===============

QGIS Processing provider for SWAT based hydrological modelling. 

This plugin was developed as part of the Water Observation Information System (WOIS) under the TIGER-NET project funded by the European Space Agency as part of the long-term TIGER initiative aiming at promoting the use of Earth Observation (EO) for improved Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Africa.

It contains functionality to: 
- Help with setting up a SWAT model
- Calibrate the model 
- Download and update the latest climatological data used to drive the model
- Assimilate in-situ discharge information
- Run the model
- Visualise results

This plugin depends on other software (MapWindow, MWSWAT, SWATeditor and PEST) to function properly. Therefore, it is recommended to install it as part of the WOIS software package, available for download from http://www.tiger.esa.int/page_eoservices_wois_form.php.
